We need new infrastructure, a 21st-century global music library to collect musical information (scores, audio, text, and metadata) and make it accessible by providing tools for searching and analysis. Our research program, Music Information, Research, and Infrastructure (**MIRAI**), is building this infrastructure by

* designing the workflows to gather musical information;
* converting and formatting this information to be easily accessible by people and computers;
* conducting research on the information behavior of music scholars; and
* developing user-centered analytical tools to navigate and promote research using this data.

The main goal of our research program is to study and answer questions about how humans interact
with music as information, using computational tools to gain new insights into musical search, information retrieval, and analysis. Our research program may be described as “data-intensive musicology,” a comprehensive research program for music information retrieval and computer-aided musicology with large amounts of music information. The research supported by MIRAI will provide unprecedented access to user-oriented tools for analyzing large databases of music (tens of millions of recordings and musical scores).
