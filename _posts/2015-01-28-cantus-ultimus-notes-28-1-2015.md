#### Salzinnes Exhibit Ideas
Jennifer's ideas for the exhibit include:
1. having an interface to allow people to interact with the MS (should not be connected to the internet)
-  Andrew recommended setting up a laptop or desktop computer for the MS interface
2. a that display tracks the progress of the music on the page while a recording plays (ambient sound, not in headphones)
- Andrew says that one of the MA students in the lab is developing software that could be used for this
- Jennifer will explore the possibility of using the Anon. 4 recording of music from the Salzinnes
- she will listen to the Anon. 4 recording with the MS, to make sure they followed the versions exactly
- we will also need to get permission from Anon. 4 and CBC
- St. Roch, St. Hubert, and Marian selections are possible repertoire

#### Concert and Perhaps Recording from Salzinnes for SIMSSA in Halifax
- seeking a Connections Grant to fund making a new recording, if the Anon. 4 is not adequate
- potential performers were discussed
- travel could be covered by SIMSSA

#### Protocols
- Debra, Barbara, and Alessandra will have a Skype meeting to discuss protocols for Cantus

#### Rationale-on teamwork
- putting together an article on the creation of Cantus Ultimus
- Jennifer will send out a document about this a week before the next meeting
- Jennifer will send Debra wishlist of the next step

#### Out Reach
- possible events at the Med-Ren in Brussels
- no team-meeting at Med-Ren, since the European Libraries will have already met

#### The next meeting will be on Feb. 11th at 10:30 Halifax / 9:30 Quebec & Ontario
- we will use Google Hangout
- to discuss a new time for meetings over email, so that Alessandra can attend meetings
