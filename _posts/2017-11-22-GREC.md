Earlier this month, four SIMSSA Participants visited Kyoto for the 12th IAPR International Workshop on Graphics Recognition ([GREC 2017](http://grec2017.loria.fr/)). This conference was held in conjunction with the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition ([ICDAR](http://u-pat.org/ICDAR2017/index.php), in its 14th edition).

Project Director Ichiro Fujinaga was the [IAPR](http://www.iapr.org/index.php) invited speaker, and gave a talk on the history of OMR titled "A Retrospective on Optical Music Recognition Research", detailing the history of OMR since the 1960s.

SIMSSA Postdoc Jorge Calvo-Zaragoza presented some recent work, co-authored with Ké Zhang, Zeyad Saleh, Gabriel Vigliensoni, and Ichiro Fujinaga: [Music Document Layout Analysis through Machine Learning and Human Feedback]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/files/GREC2017-Jorge.pdf).

Finally, we were very proud to send two of the undergraduates we hired last summer! You might remember Ké and Zeyad from [this post last May](https://simssa.ca/blog/introducing-the-ddmal-summer-workers), when they were just getting started on [Pixel.js](https://github.com/ddmal/pixel.js). Here they are below, demonstrating their tool for ground truth creation in a presentation titled [Pixel.js: Web-based Pixel Classification Correction Platform for Ground Truth Creation]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/files/GREC2017-Ke-Zeyad.pdf).

As it turns out, OMR is actually one of the more challenging tasks for document analysis, so there was a lot of interest in the subject. Our researchers were able to participate in a large group disucssion on the challenges of OMR held as part of the conference, shown below (image courtesy of [@Grec2017](https://twitter.com/Grec2017))

Our main goal with SIMSSA involves making musical scores searchable through OMR but it's exciting to be able to contribute to other fields along the way -- Thanks to everyone at GREC and also to our researchers for all their hard work!
