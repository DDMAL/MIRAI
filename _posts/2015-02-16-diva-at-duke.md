We always love hearing how our tools are helping libraries and archives, even if they're not being used specifically for music analysis. Our [Diva.js](http://ddmal.github.io/diva.js) image viewer is one of our flagship projects, and we're excited to see what the folks at [Duke University Libraries](http://library.duke.edu) have been doing with Diva.

The David M. Rubinstein Rare Book & Manuscript Library has been engaged in a project to digitize their collection of early Greek manuscripts dating from the 9th to 17th centuries. Each book is captured at a [very high resolution](http://blogs.library.duke.edu/bitstreams/2015/02/05/indiana-jones-greek-manuscripts/). They then convert their digitized images to the Pyramid TIFF format, and [present them online](http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/earlymss/?page=1). By the end of 2015 they are hoping to have all 106 of their Early Manuscripts Collection digitized and available online.

Additionally, they have significant documents like a [manuscript copy of the Haitian Declaration of Independence](http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/rubenstein_hdims01001/) available for close scrutiny.

They've even figured out a way to provide document views embedded in a webpage, so that their library collections can be embedded in blog posts around the web!
