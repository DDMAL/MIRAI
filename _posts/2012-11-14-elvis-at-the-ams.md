Seven members of McGill's ELVIS team have just returned from New Orleans, where ELVIS was presented alongside the SIMSSA project at the [AMS/SMT conference](http://www.ams-net.org/neworleans/). On November 1st, in a joint AMS/SMT session entitled "New Digital Projects for the Study and Dissemination of Medieval and Renaissance Music," a panel discussion where Julie Cumming presented ELVIS and also delivered a paper on collaborative research in digital humanities. The members of the panel as well as some of the discussions which ensued can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/a/haverford.edu/ams_digitalearlymusic/the-panel) as well as in the program book, available for download on the [AMS site](http://www.ams-net.org/neworleans/). The crowd of around seventy scholars was very enthusiastic, and we are especially touched by Susan Boynton's (Columbia University) public appreciation of both the **Liber** and **Salzinnes** projects as she described their usefulness as pedagogic tools.

That evening, the ELVIS members from different universities took advantage of being in the same place at the same time to meet and discuss what the various teams are up to and to talk about where it will go in the future. Present were:

McGill Faculty: Julie Cumming, Ichiro Fujinaga, Peter Schubert, Ren√© Rusch.
McGill Students: Christopher Antila, Natasha Dillabough, Alexander Morgan.
US: Michael Cuthbert, MIT; Ian Quinn, Yale; Chris White, Yale Graduate student (and co-author with Ian Quinn)
Advisory Board members: Robert Gjerdingen, David Headlam, Laurent Pugin.

The next day, November 2nd, the SIMSSA project hosted a lunch meeting for invited guests, mostly musicologists in Medieval and Renaissance Music. Ichiro Fujinaga presented SIMSSA for half an hour, while Julie Cumming spent the other half hour discussing ELVIS. The reaction was enthusiastic and the discussions following provided us with some useful feedback.
