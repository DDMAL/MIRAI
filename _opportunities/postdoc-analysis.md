<br>  

The Single Interface for Music Score Searching and Analysis (SIMSSA) project at McGill University’s Schulich School of Music seeks a Postdoctoral Researcher in music information retrieval with a demonstrable interest and strengths in developing software for musical searching and analysis. SIMSSA is a seven-year research partnership grant funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, headed by Ichiro Fujinaga, Primary Investigator and Julie Cumming, Co-investigator.

The goal of this project is to make digital images of musical notation searchable and analyzable. The team brings together cutting-edge researchers with the digital musical resources and expertise of partner institutions, including DIAMM, the Bibliothèque nationale de France, the British Library, and the Archives of the New York Philharmonic. The research team is divided into two axes—Content, headed by Ichiro Fujinaga, which addresses the process of creating OMR (optical music recognition) systems for transforming digital images of music into searchable symbolic notation; and Analysis, headed by Julie Cumming, which develops tools for large-scale search and analysis. The Researcher will work with Julie Cumming on the Analysis axis, supervising a research group of graduate and undergraduate students; the position will also involve close collaboration with the Content team.

**Preferred Qualifications:**

- PhD in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Music Technology, Music Theory,  Musicology, Information Science, or related fields
- Knowledge of music theory and analysis, especially for early music
- Fluency in programming and scripting
- Familiarity with music analysis toolkits such as music21 or Humdrum
- Experience with designing and managing websites and databases
- Track record of publications and presentations in relevant fields (e.g., [ISMIR](https://www.ismir.net/), [SMT](https://societymusictheory.org/))

**Practicalities:**

Postdoctoral researchers have dual status as both students and McGill employees, and are members of the AMURE (Postdocs) bargaining unit. Their pay, benefits, working conditions, etc. are governed by their [collective agreement](https://mcgill.ca/hr/files/hr/postdoctoral_fellows_-_arbitral_decision_-_collective_agreement.pdf).

The salary will be $42,000 CAD per annum with a health and dental plan. The one-year position will begin in late May 2019 and there is a possibility of a 1-year renewal. Adjudication will begin February 4, 2019 and continue until the position is filled. After reviewing the applications, we will hold skype interviews with selected candidates in mid-to-late February.

**Applications should consist of:**  

- a cover letter
- a curriculum vitae
- an article-length writing sample
- three reference letters, sent by the referees, with the candidate’s name in the subject line

Materials should be addressed to Julie Cumming and Ichiro Fujinaga, but sent to Emily Hopkins, SIMSSA Project Manager, at <emily.hopkins@mcgill.ca>. Referees should e-mail their letters to the same address.
