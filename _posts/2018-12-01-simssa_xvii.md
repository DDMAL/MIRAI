Earlier this month we had our seventeenth SIMSSA workshop, this time here at McGill in collaboration with CIRMMT). Sally Jo Cunningham gave a CIRMMT Distinguished Lecture earlier that week on [Engagement with Personal Music Collections](https://www.cirmmt.org/activities/distinguished-lectures/sally-jo-cunningham) which inspired our theme: Infrastructure for Music Discovery. We had 19 different speakers covering everything from OMR to library reference models to linked data to country music! Here is a roundup of all the presenterâ€™s slides and some pictures from the event.

To start the day, Ichiro Fujinaga gave us an overview of the project, including the most recent workshops and other activities. (Slides: PDF). After that, I (Emily Hopkins) gave an introduction to the different components of the SIMSSA project, explaining how they all come together in context. (Slides: Powerpoint and PDF)
