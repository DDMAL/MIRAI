As part of our ongoing development of tools necessary to support the OMR of musical materials, we are launching the first beta version of [LibMEI](http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/libmei), a C++ application library that supports the reading and writing of MEI music notation files.

This launch is timed to coincide with a talk given at the 2011 International Society of Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) conference in Miami, FL. This talk, titled ["The Music Encoding Initiative as a document-encoding framework"](http://ismir2011.ismir.net/papers/OS3-1.pdf) describes how MEI can be used to rapidly develop support for new notation encoding systems.

The [LibMEI website](http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/libmei) has more information about this software, including how to get and use software, documentation, and an issue tracker.
